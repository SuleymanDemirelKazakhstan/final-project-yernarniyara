## Project
The main goal is to design IOT system for health care system in order to upgrade and improve current situation in our country. The system will be automated with Arduino and helping programming technologies so that to create connected system and prototype for a huge project.
The impact will be enourmous, prices for the project will cost 5 times cheaper than existing technologies abroad.
IOT system needs such controllers as:
 - temprature controllers for laboratories and refrigirating cameras. This will be useful and new because we will provide remote access to temprature;
 - light controllers at operating rooms and hospital in general. Sometimes there is an electricity issue at the hospitals. The remaining time to turn on extra power is about 5 to 8 minutes. Our system will provide less than 1 minute turning of the light system;
 - gas and other extremely dangerous particles in the air. It may cause serious issues for patients and workers at hospitals;
 - controlling cancer patients treatment through online system, which will allow them less time spending at the hospitals and even more effective treatments;
 - all of the solutions require advanced database connections and good architecture for frontend API development;
 - design structure for simple and useful application, which will be made using our UX researches


## Technologies
In our project we use:
 - **Python3** to develop backend  API for the Arduino platform
 -  **Figma** design and wireframe templates for app MVP
 -  **Swift**  for application and frontend in order to create client sided app 
 -  **Arduino UNO**  main controller for the prototype of the IOT system
