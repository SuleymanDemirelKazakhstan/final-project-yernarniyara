## Week 9

### Report on done work
We have finished developing frontend part for users and have created complex database structure for the project in order to make an easier access to databases and exclude situations with long and complex queries.

Admin panel was made with an identity as for the main Donor page.

Currently we are developing marketing strategy and advertising campaign in order to have a fast start. The main idea is to attract people from social media and online platforms. Main focus will be on most used social media in Kazakhstan and online platforms that offer medical help or pharmacies. As said before target will be on B2C sector. We can also offer other companies free advertising on our platform. 

As a whole idea our project is not requiring money as we are aiming to develop B2B relationship only by barter. Of course it won't always be free of charge but we expect them to offer us prices lower than the market prices in general.

Backend part has improvements such as working API requests in all of the websites ecosystem. As Niyara's main part is blackened she has done a lot of research to achieve most simple result.
It's important to remember that we are looking forward to create PWA application.
