### Month-by-month work
The work during each month, based on our plan was going well at the beginning, but when developing the product our team had to change the main idea and goal of the project in order to adapt it to the market of Kazakhstan as well as to adapt it to our country's healthcare system. Also the direction of product's future development has changed, so we had to develop our project based on researches we were making during each week of work. Customer testing and surveys has also shown weak parts of the original plan and some parts were improved, other parts were removed in order to make project functional and better for customer's needs.

##### February
For the February month the development process was fully focused on database. I have used my knowledge and skills from the subject Database Management Systems, which made process faster. I have created ER diagram and basic structure, which then was normalized to an optimal form. During normalization there were added several tables, which are static and won't be modified in future, but those tables make other tables easy to query.

|Entity type   | Relationship Type  | Entity type  |
|---|---|---|
| User |owns   | Donor  |
| Donor  | manages  | Donation  |
| Donation Price  | describes  | Donation  |
|  Blood Center | views  | Donation  |
| Blood Center  |  manages | Required Blood  |
| Required Blood  | views  | Blood types  |
| Donor  | owns  | Pending Achievements  |
| Medical Center  |manages   | Achievements  |
| Donor  | owns  |  Used Achievements |
|Donor   | owns  |Badges Achieved   |
| Badges Type  |  manages | Badges Achieved  |

As a technology the best solution was to use PostgreSQL, because it supports JSON format of data and the main interaction between application and backend is through JSON. I have decided to use Docker in order to organize everything in container and make it easier to deploy from localhost to server. There won't be any complications to install and manage PostgreSQL on server and also there won't be any bugs based on version mismatch and incorrect installation.
###### Key achievements:
- database ER Diagram
- Logical part of the database
- Implementation of Docker-container

**Overall result**: I have structured database, good developed connections between entities, logically correct relations between entities. Docker container allows to simplify the process of deployment.

##### March
Project development in March was hard-work on implementing the website and backend as a fully structured system, that is connected to database and has meaningful API. By plan during Week 7 I had to deal with frontend development of main page, login and registration. Implementation is on basic HTML+CSS+JS technology, but also I have used advanced methods of Jinja2 framework and learned how to write dynamic pages in Python3. The development went faster when I started using framework, because there was no need in repeated lines of code. Important stage was in connecting frontend to database directly with JavaSccript, so that I could test data transition without any backend and API. Raw data was entered in related fields and I was testing the correct work of all fields before writing advanced queries to transform and manage data on Flask backend part.
Week 8 was a development of API on Flask and there were some technical issues such as transforming data in correct format and fulfill not only one table as during raw data testing. Flask is a handy tool in development such type of web applications. Originally there was an intent to use Django framework of Python, but our application won't store a lot of data and we don't require to manipulate and transform data in advanced ways. So framework Flask allowed to develop microservice for the donation project.
The next task that was successfully done and which was main part of our project was to develop points calculation for donations that people have completed. Firstly I have written a code in frontend part for tracking blood donations and points achieved, then make needed calculations and insert data in database. 
During March we have decided that admin panel for medical users is not a field of our current interest. So the design was developed and frontend part that I began coding stopped. It is argumented in the way that all of the medical institutions have their own database systems, admin panels for workers. It wouldn't be a problem to develop integration with their systems, but we currently don't have access to personal data and private information. In the future when we will have such access there won't be a need to use physical interface, we might just develop an API to receive data and manipulate it on our side. So the main plan with developing interface for medical institutions workers was cancelled.
Last week of March required to develop database connections for medical admin panel, but this time I have decided to use to clean up the code in frontend and backend so that there is no logical mistakes. Using tutorials I have used pytest library to develop some tests and fix issues that have occured during testing.
###### Key achievements:
- Frontend and Backend for donors
- Implemented points system and achievements
- Stopping the development of admin panel for medical users and focusing mainly on B2C side of the project
- Learning new technology and libraries such as Jinja2 and PyTest

**Overall result**: Beautiful website with simple user flow and functionality, which doesn't require a lot of skills to use. Points system is working perfectly.

##### April
As the product is finished I was following the direction towards of marketing and advertising our product. A lot of researches were made during this time. Also there was no available way to work directly with medical institutions and have visits because of the quarantine. So everything was either online or free sources of information at the available web pages.
Unfortunately I didn't find any similar resources to the one that we are making, so there is lack of resource about good and bad decisions.
Russia has analog to ours which has award system, but they don't provide meaningful lab expertise as an award.
PWA development of the application is on the stage of development. I have made quiet a lot of research and read the documentation about development. So one of the main things now is to complete PWA version in order to make our web application even more easier to access.
Also during April I did testing of our application so that we could define weak parts and the parts that are bad as well as in code and in database.
The last step to finish this project is to develop business model plan and write speech and create presentation. When we will have 3 of those we will start looking for an investor, because our team needs a huge support of other people such as SMM, developers and financial help.
###### Key achievements:
- developed marketing strategy and instagram account
- created brand out of our project
- learning new technology of developing PWA application and in parallel applying it in the project

**Overall result**: we have made everything by our plan and from my side I am looking for a good advertisement, SMM, Instagram development and attracting more younger peolpe through social media.
