## Week 12

### Report on done work
This week was a tough process of advertising, targeting and attracting people to our project. Our team has been struggling with a lot of issues at marketing side because all in all it was something new to both of us. 
The Instagram page became an optimal solution for us. Because we have a content we want to share with people and mostly adults at the age of 18 to 35 are currently widely using Instagram as their main social media platform. When doing the research on target campaigns we have followed the rules of other similar projects that there are on the web.


### Key achievements
 -  construction on advertising logic
 - interaction with the design in social media 
 - designing banners, ads, posters and other similar advertising images
 - doing A/B testing on social media in order to check DO's and DONT's in design when advertising such product to masses
