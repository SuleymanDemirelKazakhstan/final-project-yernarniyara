## Week 7

### Report on done work
As the work goes on changed strategy, there is huge difference between database structure and frontend. We have developed new UI and researched on user experience in general.
Main goal for this week was to develop a prototype of our project and create MVP that can be tested.
Also this week's goal is to provide our potential users test version and make them complete basic steps of the application.
Niyara has made backend changes and created API to receive both in admin panel and in donor website which will be used. Also this week is about learning developing PWA application in order to use it for the mobile version.
Yernar has managed to complete admin panel design and interface for users. Donor interface now is complete and has design system for easier work for people who in the future will be connected to our team as a part of development.
Our main plan is still the same - develop ecosystem for blood donation and make this process digitalized and user friendly.
