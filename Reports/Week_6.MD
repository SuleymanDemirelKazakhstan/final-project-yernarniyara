\f0\fs24 \cf0 ## Week 6\
\
### Report on done work\
During week 5 and week 6 we are developing design system for the project, developing database structure and its methods of communication with backend. The key goal was to achieve database structure that doesn't have too much tables and has quiet simple structure and connections.\
As a result we have made a database consisting of 8 tables.\
Another important work was done on a frontend part. Currently the web design is being refactored so the frontend was made as a wireframe. Sooner we will only add photos and colour to it.\
And the last thing is physical implementation of database. On django models there is written all of the database structure and is implemented in postgresql.\
