### Month-by-month work
It was a great opportunity to show my skills in design. To be honest it was not easy making design for healthcare, so I had some difficulties with knowledge of the sphere.
##### February
In February, at the very beginning, I started to think over the first draft design by doing research such as competitor analysis and discovering the market.
First steps were made by making wireframes and prototypes of main pages and how it will actually work. I started to draw wireframes on paper sheets, then I used figma to convert it to digital. After I made mind maps of site to make it easy for user navigate. (User navigation)
##### Key achievements:
-Wireframes
-Prototypes
-Story-map and user navigation

##### March
After making a carcass, a shell of a site, I immediately started to think over the design system, since every UX/UI Design project needs this system to ease the process. Developing unique elements selection and compilation of icons, avatars, buttons, text fields, containers. Everything that i mentioned was in our design system. Subsequently, I needed to change my carcass to design itself by implantation of this design system. 
Later, as soon as web was finished, i didn’t forget about adaptability so I made other resolution pages for mobile version (iphone se - 320x568, iphone 11 - 375x812) and tablet version (ipad pro - 1024x1366, ipad mini - 768 x 1024)
Also in March, I made some pages for our Admin Panel for clients base. 
##### Key achievements:
-Design system
-Adaptability
-Admin Panel
 
##### April
By discovering the market and advice of the environment, the decision was made to redesign a whole site of the project, so I kept it professional. Unfortunately, it had me to strain a little, but by playing with colors and fonts and a completed design system, it didn’t take that long. 
Later, when the frontend part started, I kept adding pages and elements, since we needed some new elements to improve our site, so it was the last steps and finishing touches in my design part and project.
##### Key achievements:
-Redesign the site
-Adding new pages
