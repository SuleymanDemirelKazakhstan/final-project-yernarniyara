## Week 11

### Report on done work
As Niyara had some experience with developing ads campaigns through Facebook and Instagram, also creating logical structure to attract people. So the main goal to Niyara during this week was to construct the process of how ads are going to be structured and what are the main interests of the people in social media.
Yernar was developing designs to ads using guideline from Niyara's research and using the rules from ads manager in Facebook. This helped to create a lot of creative posts, ads, posters and banners and through the process there were a lot of designs that didn't suite the topic, which has shown how the design process goes when developing an ad campaign. So as a result we have some graphs and good vs. bad designs, which became something like a guidebook.

### Key achievements
 -  construction on advertising logic
 - interaction with the design in social media 
 - designing banners, ads, posters and other similar advertising images
 - doing A/B testing on social media in order to check DO's and DONT's in design when advertising such product to masses
