## Week 7

### Report on done work
This week was not easy for us because we were researching blood centers again and Niyara has donated blood in order to get throughout of the project and also gather information from medical workers and ask about their problems during work in particular.
Also as we move on by our schedule, we have managed to create drastic changes in database as we have included a lot more information on donors and the type of analysis. So another goal has appeared - to integrate our database with existing database of patients in hospitals. As it is already a centralized system which has all of the data we can access it if we make agreements with government to work as a one system.
Another changes were made on the frontend development and design. We currently aim on more UX and ease of use. Although a lot of young people are our aim of users, we also include some percentage of elder people.
This means that we have upgraded the strategy of promotions and user interface in general.
